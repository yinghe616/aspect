# A script for the stream editor sed to update .cc and .h files from the
# naming scheme used in ASPECT 1.5.0 to ASPECT 2.0.0. This script correctly
# updated all files within the official development version of ASPECT,
# but it is not guaranteed to work for all possible names in user plugins.
# Consequently a backup of files is strongly recommended, and the changes
# created by this script should be investigated to ensure a correct renaming.
#
# Usage for a c++ source or header file named FILENAME (possibly containing
# wildcards such as '*.cc') on Linux:
# sed -i -f update_source_files_to_2.0.0.sed FILENAME
# On MacOS:
# sed -i "" -f update_source_files_to_2.0.0.sed FILENAME
