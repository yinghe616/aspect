 * @page changes_current Changes after the latest release (v1.4.0)
 *
 * <p> This is the list of changes made after the release of Aspect version
 * 1.4.0. All entries are signed with the names of the author. </p>
 *
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> Changed: the default for "Initial adaptive refinement" cycles is
 * now 0.
 * <br>
 * (Timo Heister, 2016/06/28)
 *
 * <li> New: There is a new parameter gamma in the entropy viscosity 
 * stabilization that allows to scale the stabilization with the strain rate 
 * (in addition to the velocity).
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, 2016/06/28)
 *
 *
 * <li> New: There is now a postprocessor that outputs the heatflux
 * density at each boundary face into a text file and a 
 * postprocessor that outputs the heatflux density at each boundary
 * face for visualization.
 * <br>
 * (Jacky Austermann, 2016/06/28)
 *     
 * <li> New: There is a new function Utilities::real_spherical_harmonic
 * which calculates the values of a fully normalized real spherical harmonic.
 * <br>
 * (Ian Rose, 2016/06/28)
 *
 * <li> Changed: The files handling the free surface implementation
 * have been renamed to free_surface.h and free_surface.cc for better
 * consistency with the rest of the file names.
 * <br>
 * (Ian Rose, 2016/06/27)
 *
 * <li> Changed: The previously-deprecated functions 'composition' and
 * 'temperature' have now been removed. Their replacements are
 * 'boundary_composition' and 'boundary_temperature'.
 * <br>
 * (Sam Cox, 2016/06/27)
 *
 * <li> Changed: The free surface implementation now represents mesh
 * deformation using a vector of displacements for the mesh vertices,
 * using a MappingQ1Eulerian to transform from the reference cell to
 * the physical cell.
 * <br>
 * (Ian Rose, 2016/06/26)
 *
 * <li> Changed: The visualization postprocessor now writes every initial
 * refinement stage if 'Run postprocessors on initial refinement' is
 * set to true.
 * <br>
 * (Rene Gassmoeller, 2016/06/25)
 *
 * <li> New: There is now a postprocessor that outputs statistics about
 * the number of particles per cell in the model domain. It outputs
 * global maximum, minimum and average number of particles per cell.
 * <br>
 * (Rene Gassmoeller, 2016/06/24)
 *
 * <li> New: There is now the option to model melt transport (two-phase 
 * flow). This core of the implementations includes additional 
 * variables in the solution vector, a new assembler with an additional 
 * equation that will be solved and a modified advection equation for the 
 * porosity field, a new preconditioner for models with melt transport, and 
 * additional melt outputs for the material model.
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, Timo Heister, 2016/06/24)
 *
 * <li> New: Particles can now carry the integrated strain they have
 * experienced over the course of the model. They store all components
 * of the symmetric strain tensor, which can be converted into the 
 * invariants or investigated individually.
 * <br>
 * (Rene Gassmoeller, 2016/06/10)
 *
 * <li> New: There is a new optional feature for the discontinuous temperature
 * and compositional solutions. After solving the advection equation, 
 * a "bound preserving limiter" working as a correction procedure is applied
 * to the discontinuous advection fields. The limiter will stabilize the 
 * discontinuous advection solutions and keep it in the range of user defined 
 * global maximum/minimum values. Whether or not the limiter is used is
 * determined by an entry to the parameter file.
 * <br>
 * (Ying He, 2016/06/02)
 *
 * <li> New: Tests can now be marked that they are expected to fail by the
 * EXPECT FAILURE keyword in the .prm.
 * <br>
 * (Timo Heister, 2016/06/01)
 *
 * <li> New: There is a new boundary traction model "ascii data"
 * that prescribes the boundary traction according to pressure values
 * read from an ascii data file.
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, 2016/05/24)
 *
 * <li> New: A material model plugin for visco-plastic rheologies,
 * which combines diffusion, dislocation or composite viscous
 * creep with a Drucker Prager yield criterion.
 * <br>
 * (John Naliboff, 2016/05/19)
 *
 * <li> Changed: The traction boundary conditions now use a new interface
 * that includes the boundary indicator (analogous to the velocity boundary
 * conditions).
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, 2016/05/19)
 *
 * <li> New: There is now a visualization plugin to visualize the maximum
 * horizontal component of the compressive stress.
 * <br> 
 * (Wolfgang Bangerth, D. Sarah Stamps, 2016/05/12)
 *
 * <li> New: There is a new visualization postprocessor "artificial viscosity
 * composition" to visualize the artificial viscosity of a compositional
 * field.
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, Timo Heister, 2016/05/03)
 *
 * <li> New: Mesh refinement strategies based on artificial viscosity,
 * composition gradients, or composition threshold.
 * <br>
 * (Juliane Dannberg, Timo Heister, 2016/05/03)
 *
