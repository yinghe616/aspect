Changed: The material model interface now contains a base class for 
named additional outputs and a derived class that that can be filled 
with output for the seismic velocities in the evaluate() function. 
This replaces the member functions seismic_Vs and seismic_Vp in the
material model inteface, and can now be used to generate graphical 
output for other quantities as well.
