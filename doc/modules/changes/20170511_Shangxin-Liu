New: ASPECT can now compute geoid in 3D spherical shell geometry. 
The calculation is based on spherical harmonics from min to max degree and 
the final results are transferred into cartesian coordinates. The users can 
also choose to output the spherical harmonics of geoid, density contribution part, 
surface dynamic topography part, and CMB dynamic topography part respectively.
