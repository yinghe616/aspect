Refactored the SolKz benchmark and added the SolKz benchmark with
compositional fields and the SolKz benchmark using active
particles. For all three cases, we used Q2_Q1 elements with
Q2 temperature and Q2 compositional fields for SolKz and
discontinuous piecewise constant composition field for the
active particle case.
