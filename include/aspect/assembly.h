       *   using a large number of <code>switch</code> or <code>if</code>

       *   or approximation into a collection of functions for this particular
       *   purpose. The approach chosen here in essence allows the
       *   implementation of each set of equations in its own scope, and we
       *   then just need to store a pointer to the function that
       *   assembles the Stokes system (for example) for the selected
       *   approximation. The pointer to this function is stored in the
       *   appropriate member variable of this class.
       * - Sometimes, we want to assemble a number of terms that build on
       *   each other. An example is the addition of free boundary terms
       *   to the Stokes matrix. Rather than having to "know" in one
       *   place about all of the terms that need to be assembled,
       *   we simply add the function that computes these terms as
       *   another "slot" to the appropriate "signal" declared in this
