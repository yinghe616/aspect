    /**
     * A class that computes an initial temperature field based
     * on a user-defined adiabatic boundary for the 3D ellipsoid
     * chunk geometry model. It discretizes the model domain into
     * two regions separated by an isotherm boundary below which
     * the temperature increases adiabatically. Above the
     * user-defined isotherm boundary the temperature linearly
     * increases from a surface temperature (273.15 K or 0 degree C)
     * to the isotherm (1673.15 K or 1600 degree C). The user
     * defines the location of the isotherm boundary with an ascii
     * data file with the format defined in the ASPECT manual. Note
     * that the latitudinal and longitudinal bounds of the ascii input
     * data file need to be at least 1 degree wider than the bounds
     * you use to define the region of your ellipsoid chunk geometry.
