     * A function for evaluating real spherical harmonics. It takes the degree (l)

     * It also takes the colatitude (theta) and longitude (phi), which are in
     * radians.
     *
     * There are an unfortunate number of normalization conventions in existence
     * for spherical harmonics. Here we use fully normalized spherical harmonics
     * including the Condon-Shortley phase. This corresponds to the definitions
     * given in equations B.72 and B.99-B.102 in Dahlen and Tromp (1998, ISBN: 9780691001241).
     * The functional form of the real spherical harmonic is given by
     *
     * \f[
     *    Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi) = \sqrt{2} X_{l \left| m \right| }(\theta) \cos m \phi \qquad \mathrm{if} \qquad -l \le m < 0
     * \f]
     * \f[
     *    Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi) = X_{l 0 }(\theta) \qquad \mathrm{if} \qquad m = 0
     * \f]
     * \f[
     *    Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi) = \sqrt{2} X_{lm}(\theta) \sin m \phi \qquad \mathrm{if}  \qquad 0< m \le m
     * \f]
     * where \f$X_{lm}( \theta )\f$ is an associated Legendre function.
     *
     * In practice it is often convenient to compute the sine (\f$-l \le m < 0\f$) and cosine (\f$0 < m \le l\f$)
     * variants of the real spherical harmonic at the same time. That is the approach taken
     * here, where we return a pair of numbers, the first corresponding the cosine part and the
     * second corresponding to the sine part. Given this, it is no longer necessary to distinguish
     * between postitive and negative \f$ m \f$, so this function only accepts \f$ m \ge 0 \f$.
     * For \f$ m = 0 \f$, there is only one part, which is stored in the first entry of the pair.
     *
     * @note This function uses the Boost spherical harmonics implementation internally,
     * which is not designed for very high order (> 100) spherical harmonics computation.
     * If you use spherical harmonics of a high order be sure to confirm the accuracy first.
     * For more information, see:
