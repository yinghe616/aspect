    /**
     * A material model combining viscous and plastic deformation.
     *
     * Viscous deformation is defined by a viscous flow law describing
     * dislocation and diffusion creep:
     *   $ v = 0.5 * A^{-\frac{1}{n}} * d^{-\frac{m}{n}} *
     *               \dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}^{\frac{1-n}{n}} *
     *               \exp\left(\frac{E + PV}{nRT}\right) $
     * where
     *   where $A$ is the prefactor, $n$ is the stress exponent,
     *   $\dot{\varepsilon}_{ii}$ is the square root of the deviatoric
     *   strain rate tensor second invariant, $d$ is grain size,
     *   $m$ is the grain size exponent, $E$ is activation energy,
     *   $V$ is activation volume, $P$ is pressure, $R$ is the gas
     *   exponent and $T$ is temperature.
     *
     * One may select to use the diffusion ($\v_{diff}$; $n=1$, $m!=0$),
     * dislocation ($\v_{disl}$, $n>1$, $m=0$) or composite
     * $\frac{v_{diff}*v_{disl}}{v_{diff}+v_{disl}}$ equation form.
     *
     * Viscous stress is limited by plastic deformation, which follows
     * a Drucker Prager yield criterion:
     *  $\simga_y = C*\cos(\phi) + P*\sin(\phi)$  (2D)
     * or in 3D
     *  $\sigma_y = \frac{6*C*\cos(\phi) + 2*P*\sin(\phi)}{\sqrt(3)*(3+\sin(\phi))}$
     * where
     *   $\sigma_y$ is the yield stress, $C$ is cohesion, $phi$ is the angle
     *   of internal friction and $P$ is pressure.
     * If the viscous stress ($2*v*{\varepsilon}_{ii})$) exceeds the yield
     * stress ($\sigma_{y}$), the viscosity is rescaled back to the yield
     * surface: $v_{y}=\sigma_{y}/(2.*{\varepsilon}_{ii})$
     *
     * Several model parameters (reference densities, thermal expansivities
     * thermal diffusivities, heat capacities and rheology parameters) can
     * be defined per-compositional field.
     * For each material parameter the user supplies a comma delimited list of
     * length N+1, where N is the number of compositional fields.  The
     * additional field corresponds to the value for background material.  They
     * should be ordered ``background, composition1, composition2...''
     *
     * If a list of values is given for the density, thermal expansivity,
     * thermal diffusivity and heat capacity, the volume weighted sum of the
     * values of each of the compositional fields is used in their place,
     * for example $\rho = \sum \left( \rho_i V_i \right)$
     *
     * The individual output viscosities for each compositional field are
     * also averaged. The user can choose from a range of options for this
     * viscosity averaging. If only one value is given for any of these parameters,
     * all compositions are assigned the same value.
     * The first value in the list is the value assigned to "background material"
     * (regions where the sum of the compositional fields is < 1.0).
     *
