       * compositional fields are used to track quantities different than
       * actual compositions, for example accumulated strains in damage

       * hand sides, not as instantaneous equations. In such cases, the
       * reaction terms (i.e., the incremental additions to the previous
       * state) are usually of the form reaction rate times time step size. To
